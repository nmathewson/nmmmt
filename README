nick's minimal music maintenance tools
--------------------------------------

This is crappy one-off code that wasn't actually meant for anybody anybody
else to see. I mentioned its existence to somebody once, and they asked me
to put it online, so here goes.

I'm putting it under the public domain, under the creative commons "CC0"
license/grant/thing.  I'm including a copy of the full cc0 legal document
under doc/cc0.txt.

You probably shouldn't use these scripts.  There is probably a better
solution for you.  I did them because it was literally faster for me to write
them than to locate an existing solution, learn it, and figure out how to
make it do what I wanted.

There are two scripts here.  One of them converts a bunch of flacs in one
directory tree into a bunch of oggs in another parallel directory tree.  The
other one looks at a bunch of two-level directory trees of oggs and mp3s
(where the trees are in the form Artist/Album/Song), and copies the ones that
you select into another directory -- presumably a mountpoint for your music
player.

My paths are hardcoded in these scripts.

I organize my music by format and source.  Top-level directories have names
like "flac_dl" or "ogg_rip".  The formats are:
    flac -- my preferred lossless format
    ogg  -- my preferred lossy format. (ogg/vorbis if you're pedantic)
    misc -- other stuff.
The sources are:
    dl      -- downloaded (legally, of course)
    rip     -- ripped from CD
    flacdl  -- originally downloaded in flac, then re-encoded

I use the "abcde" command-line tool to rip CDs.

In case you care, my music player is a Sansa Clip Zip; it's cheap, it plays
ogg, mp3, and flac, and you can expand it by up to 32GB.

If it breaks, you keep both pieces.  If it deletes all your music, I hope you
kept a backup.
